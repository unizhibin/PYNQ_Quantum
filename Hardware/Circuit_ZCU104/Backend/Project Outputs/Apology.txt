Dear JLCPCB Team,

With this letter I am writing to offer my sincere apologies for the recent oversight in our PCB production process.

After ordering, it has come to my attention that there was an error in the PCB production file submitted for our recent order. 
Regrettably, the file provided by my student did not undergo the necessary design rule check, and I failed to verify that it was the correct version before submitting it to you. 
This lapse in oversight led to undesired consequences and disrupted your production process.

I am sorry that this mistake on our part has inconvenienced your operations, and I take full responsibility for the oversight. 
It was a misjudgment on my end to place undue trust without thoroughly verifying the essential aspects of the production file.

I am now taking immediate steps to rectify the situation. We will address the issue and ensure that such errors are prevented in the future. 
I will be instituting stricter verification protocols and reinforcing the importance of thorough checks before any file submission.

I deeply value your professionalism and quality service you provide. 
We highly appreciate your understanding and patience as we resolve this matter.

Once again, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. 
If there is anything further I can do to rectify this situation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

With my best regards,
Tobias Wirth
