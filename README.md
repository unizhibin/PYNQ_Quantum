## Project Description 

This is a quantum experimentation project based on PYNQ (ZYNQ FPGA from AMD Xilinx) platform. It encompasses hardware circuit design, a graphical user interface (GUI), and several corresponding experiments. In the early stages of development, we employed a range of development platforms—including PYNQ-Z2, ZCU104, ZCU111, and the Kria K26 Som—to accommodate various application environments. The system is continuously updated on a regular basis.

Most of the setups in this project utilize ASICs developed by our team. However, we also provide alternative implementations that do not require ASICs.
